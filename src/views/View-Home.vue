		<h3>
			Hi there! I’m an aspiring frontend engineer with not-so-obvious past
			experience. I used to work in customer service, accounting, art shop,
			e-commerce, also petrol business as a manager. I hope I’ll be able to push
			myself more to broaden coding skills used in my projects (at one of them
			you’re looking right now). On a private side of things, I like to learn
			languages - mainly English and German, but also to discover world of
			javascript frameworks (Vue at the moment).
