			<h3>
				<p>
					I come from little, cute village in the west part of Poland. I love
					pure nature - old forests, big, clear lakes. Now I'm living in a huge
					city, I came here to find my career path. <br />First I've been worked
					in a custommer service, merchandising, through accounting office, art
					shop, e-commerce. Most of the time I spend in a petrol businnes. It
					wasn't dream work but I loved this place because of people with who
					I've been almost every day. Finally I managed the petrol station. I
					was doing various tasks, resolving many issues (both easy and
					difficult) and I was proud from my crew's achievements. But it was
					unfortunately the end of my path in that place. I've been thinking a
					long time what I should do to improve myself. I had a couple of ideas,
					so I decided to make both happen.<br />...
				</p>
				<p>
					So, now I'm a mummy who learns everything what is curious for me.
					<br />First I started learn english from scratch (now it's B2
					according to test results), remind German words and grammar (Hier ist
					es ein bisschen schwieriger aber ich lerne immer noch ausdauernd.).<br />
					I started to read about Frontend and saw how extensive it is. I read
					deeper and deeper and created that page in Vue. Actually I still
					create, because I still learn new things.<br />Now my kid attends
					kindergarten consequently I can look for a job, but now something what
					will have a long career way, so that in the future I won't have to
					give up a job that I might love.
